The thing is for a task I don’t always have a due date, scheduled date etc. So, when I use the Capture choice in QuickAdd and I don’t have these properties for a task, I have to give an empty input to the prompts resulting in a task to have multiple useless properties added such as \" <img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/date.png?v=12\" title=\":date:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":date:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Invalid Date\". To avoid this i wanted to make a Macro that will check if an input is empty and if so the property (such as due date) is not added to the task.</p>\n<p>Being a beginner python programmer and no experience in JavaScript, I asked ChatGPT to write up the code for me. It generated the following code.</p>\n<p><code>async function captureTask() {</code></p>\n<p><code>const tag = await quickAddApi.inputPrompt(\"tag\");</code></p>\n<p><code>const taskName = await quickAddApi.inputPrompt(\"task name\");</code></p>\n<p><code>const reminderDateTime = await quickAddApi.datePrompt(\"reminder date and time\", \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\");</code></p>\n<p><code>const dueDate = await quickAddApi.datePrompt(\"due date\", \"YYYY-MM-DD\");</code></p>\n<p><code>const scheduledDate = await quickAddApi.datePrompt(\"scheduled date\", \"YYYY-MM-DD\");</code></p>\n<p><code>const priority = await quickAddApi.suggester([\"⏫\", \"🔼\", \"🔽\", \" \"], [\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\", \"None\"]</code>);</p>\n<p><code>let taskString = '';</code></p>\n<p><code>if (tag) {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code>#${tag} `;</p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>if (taskName) {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code>${taskName} `;</p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>if (reminderDateTime) {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code><img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/alarm_clock.png?v=12\" title=\":alarm_clock:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":alarm_clock:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ${reminderDateTime} `;</p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>if (dueDate) {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code><img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/date.png?v=12\" title=\":date:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":date:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ${dueDate} `;</p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>if (scheduledDate) {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code><img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/hourglass_flowing_sand.png?v=12\" title=\":hourglass_flowing_sand:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":hourglass_flowing_sand:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> ${scheduledDate} `;</p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>if (priority &amp;&amp; priority !== \" \") {</code></p>\n<p><code>taskString += \\</code>${priority}<code>;</code></p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>return taskString.trim();</code></p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p><code>const taskString = await captureTask();</code></p>\n<p><code>if (taskString) {</code></p>\n<p><code>await quickAddApi.addToDailyNote(taskString);</code></p>\n<p><code>}</code></p>\n<p>When running the Macro nothing happens.

For questions about a <strong>specific</strong> talk, please use the dedicated post for <em>that</em> talk (you can find a list of posts below).</p>\n<h2>What are community talks?</h2>\n<p>Obsidian Community Talks are <strong>community-organised</strong> presentations given <strong>by</strong> Obsidian users. Anyone is welcome to offer to <strong>give</strong> a presentation, and you can also <em>request</em> a talk. The <strong>topic</strong> of the presentations can be a professional <em>or</em> personal interest, linking to how Obsidian helps you in the process. The <strong>format</strong> can vary as you wish; one could have a collaborative project where the audience participates in solving a problem, for example.
